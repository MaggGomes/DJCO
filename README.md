# Game design

The player is late for the exam.
When he leaves his home he realizes his car is missing.
So he steals one.
The player has a set time to reach FEUP.
Spread throughout the map are cheat sheets to improve the player's grade in the exam.
The final score is defined by the player's grade and the time remaining.
